# Matteo Titus

Hi! Nice of you to ask but I am **not** a professional [matchmaker](http://superbhub.com/biography/author-matt-titus-books-wife-divorce-net-worth/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=30_9qgXAAO6K2p04Hx5PoE5BF1V_bsjNtTR8NxgvE8g-1636023034-0-gaNycGzNA5E)
I am a Master's student at [KI](https://ki.se/en) who would be keener
*on the contrary* to make 21st century diseases break up with **us**...  

### Geography

I live in Stockholm, Sweden but I was born in Switzerland. Mixing up both
 countries is said to be common for Americans, but then again I am American
and Italian as well so I cannot confirm this *clich√©*.

### Food

As is dislike cheese, I could technically be considered a **traitor** to all passeports I have.

### Contact

The best ways to get in touch with me are on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-titus-09208520b/) or  [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ma11eoo/).
